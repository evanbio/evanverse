\title{Human Gene Reference (All Genes)}
\format{
A data frame with multiple rows (genes) and columns such as \code{symbol} and \code{entrez_id}.

A data frame with multiple rows (filtered genes) and similar columns as the full set.

A data frame with rows representing genes and columns including \code{symbol} and \code{entrez_id}.

A data frame with multiple rows (filtered genes) and standard annotation columns.

A tibble with three columns:
\describe{
\item{term}{Name of the hallmark gene set}
\item{description}{Brief description of the gene set}
\item{gene}{Gene symbol associated with the term}
}

A data frame with columns representing study data for meta-analysis visualization.

Downloaded and processed from Ensembl database (via \code{download_gene_ref()} function).
Human Gene Reference (Filtered Genes)

A data frame containing a filtered subset of human genes, retaining only entries with valid \code{symbol} and \code{entrez_id}.
Used for cases requiring higher-quality gene identifiers, such as functional enrichment or ID mapping.

Derived from the full human gene reference dataset after filtering missing or invalid entries.
Mouse Gene Reference (All Genes)

A data frame containing all annotated mouse genes, used for cross-species gene analysis and mapping.
Includes both coding and non-coding genes.

Downloaded and processed from Ensembl database (via \code{download_gene_ref()} function).
Mouse Gene Reference (Filtered Genes)

A filtered version of the mouse gene reference, keeping only genes with non-missing \code{symbol} and \code{entrez_id}.
Suitable for downstream analyses that require reliable gene identifiers.

Derived from the full mouse gene reference dataset after filtering missing or invalid entries.
MSigDB Hallmark Gene Sets (Expanded Format)

A long-format tibble representing the MSigDB Hallmark gene sets, where each row corresponds to a single gene-term association.
Useful for gene set enrichment analysis and visualization.

Extracted and parsed from the MSigDB v2024.1 (h.all.v2024.1.Hs.symbols.gmt).
Test Dataset for Forest Plots

A sample dataset used for demonstrating and testing forest plot functionality.
Contains example effect sizes, confidence intervals, and study information.

Created for testing and demonstration purposes.

\description{
A data frame containing all annotated human genes, including both protein-coding and non-coding types.
This dataset is primarily used for gene ID conversion and enrichment analysis.
