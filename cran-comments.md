## Comments

This is a maintenance release focused on CRAN check compliance and code quality improvements:

* **Fixed namespace imports**: Added proper `package::function` prefixes for all base R functions (stats::setNames, utils::install.packages, etc.)
* **Removed Unicode characters**: Cleaned up emoji characters from R code files for better CRAN compatibility
* **Updated documentation**: Fixed argument mismatches in function documentation (e.g., %nin% operator)
* **Network dependency handling**: Ensured all network-dependent code in vignettes uses eval=FALSE
* **Enhanced examples**: Wrapped network-dependent examples in \dontrun{} blocks

### Release Quality Assurance

The package has undergone thorough validation:
* **Platform Testing**: Verified on Windows 11 with R 4.5.0 (all tests pass)
* **CRAN Compliance**: Resolved all major R CMD check warnings related to namespace imports
* **Code Quality**: Improved function documentation and parameter validation
* **Network Safety**: All network-dependent tests properly wrapped with skip_on_cran()

The package continues to follow all CRAN policies and guidelines:
* No modification of user's global environment
* Proper handling of temporary files and directories
* Appropriate use of system dependencies
* Clean startup without unnecessary messages
* Proper namespace management with explicit package prefixes
