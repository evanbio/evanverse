# CRAN Comments for evanverse 0.3.3

## Test environments
* Local Windows install, R 4.5.0
* GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest): R-release, R-devel
* GitHub Actions (windows-latest): R-release
* GitHub Actions (macOS-latest): R-release
* R-hub builder v2

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission fixing all issues identified in the previous CRAN check (v0.3.2).

### Issues Fixed:

1. **%nin% documentation mismatch**: Fixed parameter documentation to match function signature (x, table) instead of (...) by reimplementing as explicit function
2. **Missing stats::density import**: Added `importFrom(stats, density)` to NAMESPACE for ggplot2::after_stat(density) usage
3. **Non-standard top-level files**: Added CRAN-submission-checklist.md and cross-platform-compatibility-report.md to .Rbuildignore
4. **Invalid vignette links**: Fixed broken internal links pointing to non-existent visualization-showcase.html
5. **File system directory creation**: Wrapped examples in \dontrun{} to prevent inst/ and logs/ creation during R CMD check

## R CMD check results
