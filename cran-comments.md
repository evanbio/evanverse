## Comments

This is a maintenance release of the evanverse package with the following key improvements:

* **CRAN Policy Compliance**: Removed all emoji from code, comments, and startup messages to ensure full CRAN compliance
* **Enhanced Functions**: Added 7 new utility functions including `plot_forest()`, `plot_bar()`, `read_excel_flex()`, `write_xlsx_flex()`, `view()`, `set_mirror()`, and `pkg_functions()`
* **Improved Testing**: Expanded test coverage with proper `skip_on_cran()` usage for network-dependent tests
* **Better Documentation**: Streamlined roxygen examples for CRAN environments

All functions that require network access (e.g., `download_url()`, `convert_gene_id()`) are properly wrapped with `skip_on_cran()` in tests to prevent failures on CRAN servers.

The package follows all CRAN policies and guidelines, including:
* No modification of user's global environment
* Proper handling of temporary files and directories
* Appropriate use of system dependencies
* Clean startup without unnecessary messages
